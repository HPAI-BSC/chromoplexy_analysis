\section{Data overview}

Data is obtained from 2,784 patients, with the corresponding breaks. All patients are considered as independent instances, and all breaks as independent variables. Each break has a source or target, which simply identifies an arbitrary order of break. There are 5 types of breaks as provided by the .vcf.tsv files: h2hINV, DEL, t2tINV, DUP, TRA.


\section{Chromosome break distribution}

First we plot the number of breaks per chromosome, regardless of type.
